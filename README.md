Cyber-free browsing extension for Chrome

This simple Chrome extension allows you to browse the Internet without enduring the pain of all the "cyber"-prefixed words.

If the source of the page contains security, infosec or securite (french for security),
then the extension will simply delete the "cyber" prefixes and display a "cyber" logo in the address bar.

##Roadmap##
* v1.0 : Working extension
* v2.0 : Perform a FUD-scoring based on how many of the infosec bullshit bingo words are in the current page.
